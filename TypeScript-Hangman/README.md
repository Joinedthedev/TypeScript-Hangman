# Hangman


   Everyone knows how to play hang man but just incase...

#Directions
Type a key on your keyboard or use the one on screen to play. Each wrong guess will result in a body part of our poor hangman(lets call him Bob) rendering onto screen. Once his full body is rendered you lose! The aim of the game is to guess the word correctly before Bob is fully rendered. That's all! Have fun!
